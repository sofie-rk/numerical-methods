# Documentation - polynomial interpolation

You have a set of n+1 unique points (x_i, y_i).

Then, there exists an unique polynomial of maximum degree n which interpolates the points (x_i, y_i).

Two interpolation techniques is implemented here; Lagrange interpolation and Newton interpolation. They will give the same results (due to the uniqueness of the interpolation polynom). Lagrange is easier to calculate and understand. Newton is better if you want to expand or decrease number of interpolation points.
